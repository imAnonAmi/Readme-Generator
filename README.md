## Installation
This application requires npm inquirer, fs, utils, and axios.

## Usage
Run index.js and follow prompts

# Known Issues
1. At present does not work. Data is not being passed from index to api.js, or generateMarkdown.js
2. Will return to this once I have had the time to practice the lessons; the 9 day long failure to install 'node modules' bug I struggled with functionally meant I was unable to follow along or practice while we were learning this)
